科学家如何对DeepChem做贡献
======================================

科学圈子在很多方面都非常传统。
比如，导师和学生是一种学徒制的关系，一个导师通常带少量的学生。

这个模式已经存在了多个世纪，并且可以帮助新生学习高级科学家的思维方式。


具体来说，当今大多数科学研究都是在以这种传统方式在实验室中进行的。 
首席研究员负责运营整个实验室，和本科生、研究生、以及博士一起进行科学研究并发表论文。

实验室运营费用是由基金资助的，基金通常来自政府和慈善机构。 
论文和引用是该系统的关键货币，拥有强大的论文发表记录对于任何科学家来说都是必须的。 

**由于多种原因，在这种模式下很难开发出高质量的软件。**
第一，学生在实验室中呆的时间有限（通常为3-5年）。
这意味着高流动性，当学生毕业离开的时候，关键知识可能会丢失。 

第二，对软件资助的资金比较少，很难获得。
实验室可能选择专注于科学发现而不是必要的软件工程。 （虽然，
值得注意的是，有许多例外情况！比如DeepChem等其他高质量的软件目诞生于学术实验室
项目。） 



我们相信，对DeepChem的贡献和使用对科学职业非常有帮助。
DeepChem可以长期帮助维护新的科学算法，确保学生毕业后继续使用您的代码继续被使用。
 
我们已经看到太多精彩的项目在学生毕业后陷入困境，
而我们可以助您确保你的算法具有最大的影响力。 

**让你的学生把你的算法贡献到DeepChem项目中，这样后续DeepChem开发人员会帮忙维护。**

使用自己的软件包而不是使用DeepChem，对我的职业生涯会更好吗？ 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The answer to this really depends on what you're looking for out of
your career! Making and maintaining good software is hard. It requires
careful testing and continued maintenance. Your code will bitrot over
time without attention. If your focus is on new inventions and you
find software engineering less compelling, working with DeepChem may
enable you to go further in your career by letting you focus on new
algorithms and leveraging the DeepChem Project's infrastructure to
maintain your inventions.

In addition, you may find considerable inspiration from participating
in the DeepChem community. Looking at how other scientists solve
problems, and connecting with new collaborators across the world can
help you look at problems in a new way. Longtime DeepChem contributors
find that they often end up writing papers together!

All that said, there may be very solid reasons for you to build your
own project! Especially if you want to explore designs that we haven't
or can't easily. In that case, we'd still love to collaborate with
you. DeepChem depends on a broad constellation of scientific packages
and we'd love to make your package's features accessible to our users.

是否有 DeepChem 首席研究员?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
While DeepChem was born in the Pande lab at Stanford,
the project now lives as a "decentralized research organization."
It would be more accurate to say that there are informally multiple "DeepChem PIs,"
who use it in their work. You too can be a DeepChem PI!

我是否需要将DeepChem团队成员添加为论文的共同作者？ 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Our suggestion is to use good judgment and usual scientific etiquette.
If a particular DeepChem team member has contributed a lot to your effort,
adding them might make sense. If no one person has contributed sufficiently,
an acknowledgment or citation would be great!

I want to establish my scientific niche. How can I do that as a DeepChem contributor? Won't my contribution be lost in the noise?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
It's critically important for a new scientist to establish themselves and
their contributions in order to launch a scientific career. We believe that
DeepChem can help you do this! If you add a significant set of new features to DeepChem,
it might be appropriate for you to write a paper (as lead or corresponding author or however makes sense)
that introduces the new feature and your contribution.

As a decentralized research organization, we want to help you launch
your careers. We're very open to other collaboration structures that
work for your career needs.

I'm an aspiring scientist, not part of a lab. Can I join DeepChem?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Yes! DeepChem's core mission is to democratize the use of deep learning for the sciences.
This means no barriers, no walls. Anyone is welcome to join and contribute.
Join our developer calls, chat one-on-one with our scientists,
many of whom are glad to work with new students. You may form connections that
help you join a more traditional lab, or you may choose to form your own path.
We're glad to support either.


DeepChem有基金支持吗
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Not yet, but we're actively looking into getting grants to support DeepChem researchers.
If you're a PI who wants to collaborate with us, please get in touch!

我是工业界的研究员，我可以加入吗？
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Yes! The most powerful features of DeepChem is its community.
Becoming part of the DeepChem project can let you build a network that lasts across jobs and roles.
Lifelong employment at a corporation is less and less common. Joining our community will
let you build bonds that cross jobs and could help you do your job today better too! 

知识产权怎么归属？
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
One of the core goals for DeepChem is to build a shared set of
scientific resources and techniques that aren't locked up by patents.
Our hope is to enable your company or organization to leverage
techniques with less worry about patent infringement.

We ask in return that you act as a responsible community member
and put in as much as you get out. If you find DeepChem very
valuable, please consider contributing back some innovations or
improvements so others can benefit. If you're getting a patent on your
invention, try to make sure that you don't infringe on anything in
DeepChem. Lots of things sneak past patent review. As an open source
community, we don't have the resources to actively defend ourselves
and we rely on your good judgment and help!

如果我在内部数据上使用DeepChem，是否需要发布数据？ 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Not at all! DeepChem is released with a permissive MIT license. Any
analyses you perform belong entirely to you. You are under no
obligation to release your proprietary data or inventions.

如果我要发布数据怎么办？ DeepChem可以提供帮助吗？ 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you are interested in open sourcing data, the DeepChem project
maintains the
[MoleculeNet](https://deepchem.readthedocs.io/en/latest/moleculenet.html)
suite of datasets. Adding your dataset to MoleculeNet can be a
powerful way to ensure that a broad community of users can access your
released data in convenient fashion. It's important to note that
MoleculeNet provides programmatic access to data, which may not be
appropriate for all types of data (especially for clinical or patient
data which may be governed by regulations/laws). Open source
datasets can be a powerful resource, but need to be handled with care.

 MoleculeNet数据集都是关于分子的吗?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Not anymore! Any scientific datasets are welcome in MoleculeNet. At
some point in the future, we may rename the effort to avoid confusion,
but for now, we emphasize that non-molecular datasets are welcome too.

MoleculeNet是否允许以不同的许可证发布数据？ 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
MoleculeNet already supports datasets released under different
licenses. We can make work with you to use your license of choice.
