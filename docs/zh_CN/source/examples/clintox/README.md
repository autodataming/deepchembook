# Clintox dataset models

The Clintox dataset is a collection of "clinical toxicity" datasets that compares drugs approved by the FDA and drugs that have failed clinical trials for toxicity reasons. It contains two classification tasks for 1491 compounds:

1) Clinical trial toxicity/non-toxicity
2) FDA approval status

In this example, we construct fully connected deep networks and
graph convolutional models for the task of predicting clinical
toxicity/FDA approval status from molecular structure.
