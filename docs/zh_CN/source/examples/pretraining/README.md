# Pretraining Example

In this example we will walk you through the use of pretraining
to transfer learned weights from a trained model to a new model.

The code for transfering pretrained weights for a
fully-connected network is in `fnet_pretraining.py`. To run this
example, execute the following command in your shell

```
python fcnet_pretraining.py
```
