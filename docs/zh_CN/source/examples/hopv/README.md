# Harvard Organic Photovoltaic Dataset

The HOPV datasets consist of the "Harvard Organic
Photovoltaic Dataset. This dataset includes 350 small
molecules and polymers that were utilized as p-type materials
in OPVs. Experimental properties include: HOMO [a.u.], LUMO
[a.u.], Electrochemical gap [a.u.], Optical gap [a.u.], Power
conversion efficiency [%], Open circuit potential [V], Short
circuit current density [mA/cm^2], and fill factor [%].
Theoretical calculations in the original dataset have been
removed (for now).

In this example, we train models on the HOPV dataset to predict these properties.
