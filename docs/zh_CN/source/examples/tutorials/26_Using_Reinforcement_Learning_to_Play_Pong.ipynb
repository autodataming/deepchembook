    "To run DeepChem within Colab, you'll need to run the following cell of installation commands. This will take about 5 minutes to run to completion and install your environment. To install `gym` you should also use `pip install 'gym[atari]'` (We need the extra modifier since we'll be using an atari game). We'll add this command onto our usual Colab installation commands for you"

    "Reinforcement learning involves an *agent* that interacts with an *environment*.  In this case, the environment is the video game and the agent is the player.  By trial and error, the agent learns a *policy* that it follows to perform some task (winning the game).  As it plays, it receives *rewards* that give it feedback on how well it is doing.  In this case, it receives a positive reward every time it scores a point and a negative reward every time the other player scores a point.\n",

    "Next we create a model to implement our policy.  This model receives the current state of the environment (the pixels being displayed on the screen at this moment) as its input.  Given that input, it decides what action to perform.  In Pong there are three possible actions at any moment: move the paddle up, move it down, or leave it where it is.  The policy model produces a probability distribution over these actions.  It also produces a *value* output, which is interpreted as an estimate of how good the current state is.  This turns out to be important for efficient learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model begins with two convolutional layers to process the image.  That is followed by a dense (fully connected) layer to provide plenty of capacity for game logic.  We also add a small Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU).  That gives the network a little bit of memory, so it can keep track of which way the ball is moving.  Just from the screen image, you cannot tell whether the ball is moving to the left or to the right, so having memory is important.\n",
